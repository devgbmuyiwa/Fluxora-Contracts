//! WASM build reproducibility — checksum verification and storage key layout invariants.
//!
//! This module documents and tests two orthogonal concerns:
//!
//! 1. **Build reproducibility**: invariants that the CI checksum verification relies on.
//! 2. **Storage key layout stability**: discriminant assignments for `DataKey` that must
//!    never change for any deployed contract instance.
//!
//! Neither section performs I/O or reads files at runtime.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Build reproducibility contract
//!
//! The following invariants must hold for a build to be reproducible:
//!
//! 1. **Rust toolchain** is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` to a specific
//!    channel (`1.94.1`) and target set (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`).
//! 2. **soroban-sdk** version is pinned in `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml`
//!    (currently `21.7.7`).
//! 3. **Build profile** is `--release` with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
//! 4. **No feature flags** beyond the default are used during WASM builds
//!    (the `testutils` feature is only for `#[cfg(test)]`).
//! 5. **No environment-dependent code** is compiled into the WASM artifact.
//!
//! ## Current checksum computation and validation behavior
//!
//! The checksum flow is intentionally **off-chain only**:
//!
//! - `script/update-wasm-checksums.sh` rebuilds the release WASM artifacts and writes
//!   SHA-256 digests into `wasm/checksums.sha256`.
//! - `script/verify-wasm-checksum.sh` optionally rebuilds, then recomputes SHA-256
//!   digests for the raw `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm` artifacts and
//!   compares them against the committed file.
//! - The contract itself does **not** compute or persist any checksum at runtime.
//! - The `upgrade(env, new_wasm_hash)` entrypoint does **not** validate that the hash
//!   matches `wasm/checksums.sha256`; it only enforces admin auth and then delegates
//!   hash existence/validity checks to Soroban's
//!   `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)` host function.
//! - In the Soroban Rust test environment, arbitrary WASM blobs are not preloaded, so
//!   an otherwise-authorized upgrade using `[0u8; 32]` reaches the host and traps with
//!   `Error(Storage, MissingValue)` rather than returning a contract-defined error.
//!
//! This means the regression surface for checksum handling is:
//! 1. The scripts must continue to hash the same release artifacts.
//! 2. The reference file must continue to describe those exact artifacts.
//! 3. The contract upgrade path must remain auth-gated while leaving artifact
//!    authenticity to deployment-time/off-chain verification and Soroban host checks.
//!
//! If any of these invariants change, the reference checksum in
//! `wasm/checksums.sha256` must be regenerated via
//! `script/update-wasm-checksums.sh`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Storage key layout invariants (V5 → V6 → V7)
//!
//! `DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum. Soroban serialises enum variants by
//! their **0-based declaration-order discriminant**. Reordering, inserting, or
//! removing variants silently corrupts every persistent storage entry on any
//! live instance.
//!
//! ## V5 discriminant table (CONTRACT_VERSION = 5)

//! Total live `DataKey` variant count in V7 (before post-V7 additions): **29** (discriminants 0–28).
//! Current live `DataKey` variant count: **37** (discriminants 0–36) — see post-V7 additions below.
//!
//! V6 `Stream` struct adds one field at the end:
//!
//! | Position | Field  | Type              |
//! |:--------:|:-------|:------------------|
//! | 14       | `memo` | `Option<Bytes>`   |
//!
//! All V5 persistent `Stream` entries remain decodable on a V6 instance because
//! Soroban XDR struct decoding is **positional and forward-compatible**: a V6
//! decoder reading a V5-encoded struct will see `memo` as absent (`None`).
//!
//! ## V7 additions (discriminants 21–28)
//!
//! | Discriminant | Variant                         | Storage   | Value type            |

//!
//! These eight variants were appended incrementally across several prior changes
//! (`IdReservation` in issue #584, `TotalKeeperFeesPaid` in issue #623, and others)
//! without ever being consolidated into a single documented table or accompanying
//! variant-count test — this section and the `v7_*` tests below close that gap
//! retroactively. No `Stream` struct field changes accompanied these additions;
//! the V6 `Stream` layout (15 fields, `memo` at position 14) is unchanged in V7.
//!
//! ### Why `CONTRACT_VERSION` was not bumped to 7
//!
//! Per `docs/upgrade.md`'s "When to increment" policy, a version bump is **required**
//! only for changes that break a correctly-written existing client (removed/renamed
//! entry-points, changed parameter types, changed error/event shapes, or storage
//! layout changes that make *existing* entries unreadable). Purely additive
//! `DataKey` variants satisfy none of those: per the append-only invariant below,
//! they neither reorder nor remove any existing discriminant, so every V6-era
//! persistent entry remains byte-identical and readable. This is a strictly
//! narrower footprint than the policy's "Add a new entry-point (purely additive)"
//! row — itself only *recommended*, not required, to bump conservatively (contrast
//! the `transfer_sender` note in `docs/upgrade.md`, which chose to bump for a new
//! *entry-point*). Of these eight variants, only `IdReservation` gained a
//! corresponding read view (`get_id_reservation`); that entry-point addition was
//! deliberately treated the same permissive way. At the time these eight
//! variants were appended, `CONTRACT_VERSION` was deliberately left at `6` on
//! that basis alone. `CONTRACT_VERSION` has since been incremented to its
//! current value (see [`crate::CONTRACT_VERSION`] and `docs/upgrade.md`) for
//! unrelated, later, integrator-visible changes — not retroactively because of
//! these V7 additions.
//!
//! ## Invariant: discriminants 0–14 are frozen

//!
//! Total `DataKey` variants in V7 (before post-V7 additions): **29** (discriminants 0 through 28).
//!
//! ## V8/V9 additions (discriminants 29–36)
//!
//! | Discriminant | Variant                              | Storage    | Value type           |
//! |:------------:|:-------------------------------------|:-----------|:---------------------|

//! | 31           | `SenderStreams(Address)`             | Persistent | `Vec<u64>`           |

//! | 35           | `PooledStreamWithdrawn(u64,Address)` | Persistent | `i128`               |
//! | 36           | `DelegatedCancelNonce(Address)`      | Persistent | `u64`                |
//!
//! These variants are strictly append-only: no existing discriminant 0–28 was
//! changed. The live v9 total is **37** variants (0–36), and the next safe append
//! position is 37. Additive keys may remain under the current contract version,
//! but their absent-key behavior and the exhaustive compatibility map must be
//! updated in the same change.
//!
//! See [`docs/storage.md`](../../../docs/storage.md) and
//! [`docs/upgrade.md`](../../../docs/upgrade.md) for policy and runbooks.
//!
//! ## Invariant: discriminants 0–36 are frozen
//!
//! No variant at position 0–36 may ever be reordered, renamed, or removed on
//! an instance that may contain that key. Violations cause storage corruption.
//!
//! ## Security assumptions
//!
//! - **Append-only extension**: New `DataKey` variants must always be appended.
//!   Inserting at any position ≤ 36 shifts subsequent discriminants. The next
//!   variant must receive discriminant 37.
//! - **Struct field ordering**: `Stream` fields must never be reordered. Soroban
//!   XDR encodes structs positionally; a field swap is a silent type mismatch.
//! - **Option-tail compatibility**: The V5→V6 `memo: Option<Bytes>` addition is
//!   safe only because it is appended as the last field and is `Option`-typed.
//!   A non-`Option` field appended to a struct would break V5 decoders.
//! - **No compile-time enforcement**: Discriminant stability and variant count
//!   alignment are machine-checked by `contracts/stream/tests/storage_key_compat.rs`
//!   and documented here.
//!
//! ## Residual risks
//!
//! - **Off-chain indexers.** Any tool reading Soroban storage via RPC must be
//!   updated when new variants are appended (even append-only changes shift the
//!   total variant count visible to generic XDR parsers).
//! - **Optimised WASM.** The Stellar CLI `optimize` step may produce
//!   non-deterministic output depending on the CLI version. The reference
//!   checksum covers only the raw (unoptimised) WASM.
//! - **Dependency resolution.** `Cargo.lock` must be committed and unchanged.
//!   CI-enforced: the `build` job's "Verify Cargo.lock is committed and
//!   unchanged" step runs `cargo update --locked --workspace` before any build
//!   step and fails the build if resolution would modify `Cargo.lock` (e.g. an
//!   unpinned `^` dependency resolving differently). See
//!   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
//!
//! ## Upgrade determinism contract
//!
//! For checksum verification to remain deterministic across upgrades and retries:
//!
//! 1. **Frozen discriminants (0–14)** must never be reordered, renamed, or
//!    removed. Any violation is a silent storage corruption bug.
//! 2. **Append-only extension** ensures new `DataKey` variants start at
//!    discriminant 29. Insertions before 29 shift all subsequent discriminants.
//! 3. **Struct field ordering** is positional in Soroban XDR. Field swaps are
//!    type mismatches; append-only additions must use `Option<T>` at the tail.
//! 4. **Retry safety**: The checksum algorithm is deterministic given identical
//!    input bytes. No runtime entropy (timestamps, thread IDs, etc.) may leak
//!    into the verification path.
